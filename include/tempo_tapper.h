 * @brief Provides all necessary structs and functions to implement a tempo tapper
 * 
 * The following file Provides all necessary strucs and functions to implement a tempo tapper, i.e.
 * the tempo tapper struct and prototypes for all functions that interact with a tempo tapper struct
 * instance.
 * 
 * The tempo tapper libraries is supported by multiple target platforms.
 * Define one of the following preprocessors to select your target platform:
 * 
 * - TT_TARGET_PLATFORM_POSIX - Posix compliant platforms (Ex. Linux, MacOS, etc.)
 * - TT_TARGET_PLATFORM_ARDUINO - Platforms that support the Arduino programming framework

/**
 * @brief Tempo tapper struct
 * 
 * The following struct represents a virtual tempo tapper,
 * and stores the necessary information to set, alter and
 * receive a tempo value.
 * 
 * To create and interface with a tempo tapper struct, use the following
 * functions:
 * 
 * - tt_new() - Creates a new tempo tapper struct
 * - tt_period_us() - Returns the period of a tempo in microseconds
 * - tt_tap() - "Taps" the tempo tapper
 * - tt_reset() - Resets the tempo tapper
 * - tt_bpm() - Returns the tempo in BPM
 * 
 * To store time values, the platform varying tt_time_t typedef is used, as each
 * platform offers its own preferred data type or struct to store time values
 * (Ex. timeval on posix). This means that time arithmetic is implemented differently
 * on every platform (see current_time(), add_time(), sub_time(), time_to_us(), reset_time()).
 * For the library user, this is irrelevant as platform specific code is handled
 * by the library internally. The only noticable external difference may be a variation
 * in speed and precision.
